#Creating a Vigenere Cipher program 

#create a dictionary translating each character to their corresponding numerical value, and vice versa
#create a function that has the message and key as its parameters used for encryption
    #convert each character in the message and key into their corresponding numerical values
    #convert each character in the message to numbers from 0-25 according to the dictionary
    #convert each character in the key to numbers from 0-25
    #add both values, then mod 26
    #revert the numerical value back into text
    #append new characters into ciphertext
    #proceed to the next character
    #in case there are non-alphabet caharacters, append to the ciphertext

#create title design and introduction of the program
#ask for user's input
#call out the function
#print the ciphertext
#ask user if they want try again
    #if yes, repeat the program
    #if no, break
    #else, prompt invalid input then ask user to try again
#create program ender
